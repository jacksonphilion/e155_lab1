This repository contains the code for Lab 1 of E155 at Harvey Mudd College, taught by Prof Josh Brake.
The FPGA folder contains the necessary code to run the FPGA and 7 segment display,
the simulation folder contains the modelsim version of the code with a partially written testbench, and a screenshot showing a successful simulation of the code by forcing it.
