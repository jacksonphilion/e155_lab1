This repository contains the code for Lab 1 of E155 at Harvey Mudd College, taught by Prof Josh Brake.
The finalFPGA folder contains the necessary code to run the FPGA and 7 segment display using the intended formatting of modules within the .sv file.
Alternatively, the draftFPGA folder contains the initial code that I first made work, where all functions are integrated under a single top module. 
The simulation folder contains the modelsim version of the code with an automatic testbench that now works (Sep.8.2024). 
The Notes and Extras folder contains calculations, relevant screenshots, and more. 

You can view a full write up of this lab and all my others on my portfolio website:
